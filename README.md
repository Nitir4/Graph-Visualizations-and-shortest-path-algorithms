# Graph-Visualizations-and-shortest-path-algorithms
This is something i worked on as a freshmen for my discrete mathematics final project. This is entirely based on graph theory.
It give two choices for the graphs be it user generated or random.
Furthermore for random graphs it asks you if you want the graph to be weighted, whether it should be a directed graph, and the edge creation possibility.
For user-defined graph it asks you to input the adjacency matrix.
It then generates the graph and then there are different modes of shortest path algorithms that can be applied on it
